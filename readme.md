## Projecten III: Mobile Apps
This is part of our assignment for the course Projecten III: Mobile Apps at Hogeschool Gent 2017 - 2018.

## Waterpolo App + Backend
This is the backend API + website and admin-section for the waterpolo-app we created for the course Mobile App Projects 3. 
It is written in Laravel 5.5 + Vue.js as frontend JS lib. 

#### Backend
The backend supplies critical info to the Android app we created in conjunction: 
it delivers info about matches, teams, locations and more. 

#### Frontend
The website (http://voom.be:12005/) gives a live-feed of waterpolo matches, also gives info about players, teams, topscorers, locations, ... 

The adminsection (http://voom.be:12005/admin/- requires login) is CRUD-oriented for matches, teams, players and locations.

#### API
The API-routes can be found at: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2365272/waterpolo-api/7EK4VvF

## Docker
This app is contained in a docker-environment.

The different containers are:
* Workspace - makes artisan and other interaction possible with environment and app

* MySQL container - Database
* Selenium container - Browser testing
